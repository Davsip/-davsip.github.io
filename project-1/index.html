                                        The nutrients in the foods you eat support the activities of day-to-day living, protect your cells from environmental 
                                        damage and repair any cellular
                                         damage that might occur. Protein rebuilds injured tissue and promotes a healthy 
                                         immune system. Both carbohydrates and fats fuel your body, while vitamins and minerals
                                          function throughout your body in support of your bodyâ€™s processes. Vitamins A, C and E, 
                                          for example, act as antioxidants to protect your cells against toxins, and B vitamins help 
                                          you extract energy from the foods you eat. Calcium and phosphorus keep your bones strong, while 
                                          sodium and potassium help to transmit nerve signals. Without a healthy diet, you might compromise 
                                          any of these essential functions.

                                    Most meals at American restaurants arenâ€™t healthy. Theyâ€™re
                                    packed with processed food and enough 
                                    calories to cover two or three sensible meals.

                                    Yet itâ€™s entirely possible to eat both healthy 
                                    and tasty restaurant meals. And because eating out 
                                    is one of lifeâ€™s great pleasures, weâ€™ve put together this guide to 
                                    smart restaurant eating. It ranges from undeniably healthy meals â€” 
                                    with a rich variety of foods, heavy on fruits and vegetables, light on sugar â€” 
                                    to fast-food meals that are at least better than the alternatives if you find 
                                    yourself eating at McDonald's.
                                    Every lunch or dinner here stays under 750 calories â€” about 
                                    one-third the number many adults should eat in a day â€” and many 
                                    meals are well under; the breakfasts are under 500 calories. Weâ€™ll 
                                    start with some good news: The restaurant scene has never been better.

                 <article class= "col-m-10">If you switch to a vegan diet from a typical Western diet, you'll eliminate meat and animal products.

                                    This will inevitably lead you to rely more heavily on other foods. In the case of a whole-foods vegan diet, replacements take the form of whole grains, fruits, vegetables, beans, peas, nuts and seeds.

                                    Since these foods make up a larger proportion of a vegan diet than a typical Western diet, they can contribute to a higher daily intake of certain beneficial nutrients.

                                    For instance, several studies have reported that vegan diets tend to provide more fiber, antioxidants and beneficial plant compounds. They also appear to be richer in potassium, magnesium, folate and vitamins A, C and E (1, 2, 3, 4).

                                    However, not all vegan diets are created equal.

                                    For instance, poorly planned vegan diets may provide insufficient amounts of essential fatty acids, vitamin B12, iron, calcium, iodine or zinc (5).

                                    That's why it's important to stay away from nutrient-poor, fast-food vegan options. Instead, base your diet around nutrient-rich whole plants and fortified foods. You may also want to consider supplements like vitamin B12.</p>
