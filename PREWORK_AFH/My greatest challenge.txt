I  always thought that programing wasn't for me, programming was for really smart people, and also calculation and math was involved, and reading coding  was like WTH ! ‚òπÔ∏è
I Like creating, i have a couple projects, on that I'm currently working and needs a lot of improvements, then I was like, what if i don't hire someone else to do it, what I become a programer?  ü§î
I started reading what programing involves, and in my mind was no way I can do that!
Then started doing research about bootcamps.

Going back to the question, what I think what will be challenging for me it's JAVASCRIPT, a lot of " if" "else" calculations, numbers, everything that i didn't like before. 
I know JS it's the root for everything. Focusing it's also a personal challenge. 


To overcome the difficulties i will study hard every day, as i said " focus",  use all the resources to learn, get better everyday,  from the bootcamp team, my piers, internet, reading, reaserching, etc.

Get in my mind " I can do this " ! üèÜ
