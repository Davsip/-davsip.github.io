          <p>When it all comes to it, your professional bio is no different than any other persuasive 
            copy no mateter where it lives.One of the most common mistakes people make us thinking of 
            it as its own beast, separate form other pieces of writing.
            If you think about thsat way, you are far more likely to write something painfully uninteresting.
            WHen you sit down to to write your professionl bio just start with an introduction. The best
             bios for instance (around 200-300 words), so you dont have a lot of room to play around. But a 
             single sentence that  tees your reader up and provides context for the accomplishments that follow 
             could make the rest off your bio that much persuasive. Keep it short adn simple, stupid. No one likes 
            to hear aboout themselves talk. Above all else, just be sure to use your own best judgment, and don't 
            be afraid to ask a colleague or peer to take a look at it for you. They might catch a typo or also 
          suggest something else you should add. Anyway, if you're curious, read thiS:....</p>
