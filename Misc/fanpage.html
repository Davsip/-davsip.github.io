 <h2>Bio</h2>
   <p> Pearl Jam is an American rock band formed in Seattle, Washington, in 1990. 
	Since its inception, the band's line-up has consisted of Eddie Vedder 
	(lead vocals), Mike McCready (lead guitar), Stone Gossard (rhythm guitar) and Jeff Ament (bass).<p/>
   <p>The band's fifth member is drummer Matt Cameron (also of Soundgarden), 
 	who has been with the band since 1998. <p/>
   <p> Boom Gaspar (piano) has also been a session/touring member with the band 
 	since 2002.<p/> 
 	<p>Drummers Dave Krusen, Matt Chamberlain, Dave Abbruzzese and Jack Irons 
 	are former members of the band.<p/>

    <p> One of the key bands in the grunge movement of the early 1990s, over the 
    course of the band's career, its members became noted for their refusal to 
    adhere to traditional music industry practices, including refusing to make proper music videos or give interviews, and engaging in a much-publicized boycott of Ticketmaster. In 2006, Rolling Stone described the band as having "spent much of the past decade deliberately tearing apart their own fame.</p>
