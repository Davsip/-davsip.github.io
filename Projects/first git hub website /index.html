        <h1>The Story of Toyota Land Cruiser</h1>
        <p>Cutting through rivers, taming the harsh dirt roads and scaling mountain peaks –
         the Toyota Land Cruiser has been off-road adventuring for over 60 years.
          Debuting in 1951, the Land Cruiser is the longest produced vehicle in Toyota’s history.
          It has gone through many different phases in the course of its evolution: as an off-road
           patrol vehicle, a cross-country four wheel drive vehicle and a recreational family vehicle.
            The changes that the Land Cruiser has gone through are a testament to its durability and 
            lasting appeal. Here’s an abridged version of the Land Cruiser’s storied history. n 1951 the 
            Toyota Land Cruiser went by a different name: the Model BJ. The BJ was the embodiment of Toyota
             founder Kiichiro Toyoda’s dream of building a low price, high performance vehicle that had a good 
             fuel economy. The BJ was the result of Toyota’s bid to produce a four-wheel drive truck for the U.S.
             . Though the U.S. Army ultimately passed on the BJ, it later went on to climb to the sixth station on 
             the trail to the top of Mt. Fuji. After achieving such an incredible feat – the first vehicle to do so 
             – the BJ became the official patrol vehicle for Japanese police. In 1954 the BJ was renamed “Land Cruiser’ 
             – an accurate moniker that helped launch the vehicle into mass production.</p>
